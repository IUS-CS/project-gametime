# project-gametime

## Getting Started:

- You need to have docker installed on your local machine if you want this to work.
- Make sure that docker is in your PATH so that you can call it in the command line
- If you are on Windows or mac, you will need to use Docker Desktop to activate Docker, but after it is running in the background, everything is done in the command line

## Runtime:

to run the program use this command:
```
docker compose up --build
```
when you do that, the frontend is on:
```
http://localhost:5173/
```


The backend is exposed on:
```
http://localhost:8000/gametime/health
```
